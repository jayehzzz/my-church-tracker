## 🔑 Key Concepts

### The People Lifecycle

People in the system follow a natural progression:

```
Contact → Guest → Member → Leader
                    ↓
                 Archived
```

- **Contact**: Someone reached through evangelism, not yet visited the church
- **Guest**: Someone who has visited but isn't a regular member
- **Member**: Regular church member
- **Leader**: Member with leadership responsibilities
- **Archived**: Inactive/former member

### Activity Status

Members can also have an activity status:

- **Regular**: Consistently attends and participates
- **Irregular**: Attends sometimes but not consistently
- **Dormant**: Has stopped attending (may need outreach)

### Global Time Filtering

Almost all data views in the application respect a global time filter. Users can view data for:
- This Month / This Year / This Quarter
- Last 30 Days / Last 3/6/12 Months
- Specific Year / Month / Quarter
- Custom Date Range

## 🚀 Quick Start for Developers

1. **Understanding the data flow**:
   - Pages (`/routes`) display data
   - Components (`/lib/components`) handle UI
   - Services (`/lib/services`) fetch data
   - Convex (`/convex`) manages the database

2. **Common tasks**:
   - Adding a new data field → Start with `convex/schema.ts`
   - Adding a new page → Create in `/src/routes`
   - Adding a new chart → Create in `/lib/components/charts`
   - Modifying forms → Edit `/lib/components/forms`

3. **Key files to understand**:
   - `convex/schema.ts` - Database structure
   - `src/lib/stores/filterStore.js` - Global filtering
   - `src/lib/utils/dataService.js` - Data processing
